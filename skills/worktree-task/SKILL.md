description: Use when completing a repository change in an isolated Git worktree, consolidating its task changes into one commit, and merging it back to the starting branch.

# Worktree Task

Complete the requested change in a temporary worktree, then integrate it safely into the branch that was current when the task began.

## Rules

- Capture the original checkout, branch, and revision once; never re-infer the integration target.
- Refuse an active Git operation. If the original checkout is dirty, warn that its uncommitted changes will not enter the worktree, preserve them untouched, and proceed from the current branch's latest commit by default.
- Place the worktree at `../worktrees/<projectName>/<task-slug>` relative to the repository root, unless repository instructions override it.
- Perform all modification and verification work inside the worktree.
- Do not perform remote operations or rewrite existing original-branch history unless explicitly requested.
- Always request explicit user confirmation immediately before merging back; invoking this skill or requesting the original task does not count as confirmation.
- Preserve the task branch and worktree whenever a safety check or integration fails.

## Workflow

1. Check the repository state and refuse conflicting worktree paths or branches. Record any original uncommitted state so it can be protected and verified later.
2. Create a uniquely named task branch and worktree from the captured original branch's latest commit.
3. Establish a clean baseline, implement the task, and verify it. Before synchronization, consolidate all task changes into one commit unless the user or repository policy requires multiple commits.
4. Merge the latest local original branch into the task branch. Resolve conflicts only in the worktree, then verify and commit the synchronized result.
5. Confirm the original checkout is still on the captured branch, its committed HEAD is unchanged since synchronization, and any pre-existing uncommitted state remains intact. If HEAD advanced, repeat synchronization; stop after three races.
6. Show the target branch, task commit, change summary, verification results, and any original uncommitted state. Ask whether to merge back and wait for explicit confirmation.
7. Only after confirmation, merge the synchronized task branch back without creating an additional integration commit when possible. If integration would overwrite uncommitted state, preserve the worktree and report that integration is pending instead.
8. Verify the committed trees match, checks pass, the original branch contains the consolidated task commit, and pre-existing uncommitted state was preserved.
9. Unless asked to keep them, remove only the clean worktree and task branch created by this run after proving their content is preserved.

Report the resulting branch, commit, verification, and cleanup state.
